### GENERAL INFORMATION:
This is a Mod For SlimeRancher2 that adds a "Mods" Button to the MainMenu.
This Mod REQUIRES Melonloader 0.6 or higher!
INFO:

The Button is ignored when pressing arrow keys, so you have to use your mouse.
In it's current state the UI is very simple. 
Maybe I will add more features like a settings api for mods later on.
